Mixin :- mixin behave like object mixing layer where we pass in the target and the source.
The target is appended to the source and new object is returned.
So now we know mixin allow us to create a modified definition that can
be applied to existing superclass to create a new subclass.

//The swim property here is the mixin
let swim = {
  location() {
    console.log(`Heading ${this.direction} at ${this.speed}`);
  }
};

let Alligator = function(speed, direction) {
  this.speed = speed,
  this.direction = direction
};

//This is our source object
let alligator = new Alligator('20 mph','North');

alligator = Object.assign(alligator, swim);
console.log(alligator.location());
alligator = Object.assign(alligator, swim, crawl);
